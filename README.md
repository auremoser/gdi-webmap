# gdi-webmap
[workshop] webmapping and GIS for GDI

Just a little repo with some data and images to support the workshop.

## data
You can fork the dataset we'll be working with, and the files for the workshop. Clone the repo to download.

* Bike Rental (points) | `nyc_bikelanes.geojson`
* Bikelanes (lines) | `nyc_citibikes_osm.kml`
* Buildings (polygons) | [Via the Pluto Data Downloader](http://chriswhong.github.io/plutoplus/)

We also have a "Data Library" full of datasets that you can mashup with your own data (Boston building footprints can be found in the data library).
